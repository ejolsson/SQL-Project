Project assignment: 

Modeling and SQL Practice

Introduction

The practice will consist of solving the statement of the practice (next point) by creating the normalized Entity Relationship model and a file with the DDL commands for creating the designed model as well as the DML commands to load the tables.

It is mandatory that the script be 100% autonomous, in such a way that you only have to open it and click on the button to execute Script and everything is done (tables, PKs, relations, data). If an error occurs when executing the script, the practice will not be corrected and will automatically be unfit. In the script you must create a workspace and create all the objects in that workspace (do not use public).

Statement

At KeepCoding we want to manage the company's vehicle fleet, controlling the car models, brands and business group of the brand (for example VW SEAT, Audi etc. belong to the VAN group).

Of the cars we also need to know the color of the car, its license plate, the total number of kilometers it has, the insurance company (Mapfre, MMT, AXA, etc.), the policy number, date of purchase, etc.

In addition, we want to control for each car the revisions that have been made to the car, knowing the km it had at the time of the revision, the date of the revision and the amount of the revision.

It will be necessary to generate an SQL query to get the following list of active cars that are in keepcoding:
- Model name, brand and group of cars (the names of all) - Date of purchase
- Tuition
- Car color name - Total kilometers
- Name of the company that is insured the car - Policy number

Note: The amounts must be controlled by currency (EURO, DOLLAR etc.).
